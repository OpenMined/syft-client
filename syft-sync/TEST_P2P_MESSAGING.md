# Peer-to-Peer Messaging Test Strategy for Syft-Sync

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the P2P synchronization system in syft-sync, focusing on the unique challenges of multi-party distributed file synchronization including sync loops, message ordering, Byzantine failures, and network partitions.

## 1. P2P-Specific Sync Loop Scenarios

### 1.1 Basic Sync Loops
- **Simple Loop**: A→B→A (file bounces between two parties)
- **Triangle Loop**: A→B→C→A (three-party circular sync)
- **Self-Loop**: A modifies file received from B, triggering re-sync to B
- **Echo Loop**: Same file ping-pongs indefinitely between parties
- **Amplification Loop**: One change triggers exponential sync events
- **Version Loop**: Older versions re-syncing and triggering updates
- **Timestamp Loop**: Clock differences causing perpetual "newer" versions

### 1.2 Lock File Failures
- **Lock File Race**: Two parties create lock simultaneously
- **Stale Lock**: Lock file remains after crash, blocking sync
- **Lock Timeout**: Lock expires while sync still in progress
- **Lock Collision**: Same filename gets different locks from different sources
- **Distributed Lock Conflict**: Network partition during lock creation
- **Lock File Corruption**: Damaged lock file causes sync failure
- **Lock Permission Issues**: Can't create/remove lock due to permissions

### 1.3 Complex Loop Patterns
- **Cascading Loops**: Loop in one file triggers loops in others
- **Nested Loops**: Directory sync creates file-level loops
- **Conditional Loops**: Loops that only occur under specific timing
- **Hidden Loops**: Loops through indirect paths (A→B→C→D→A)
- **Oscillating State**: File content oscillates between N states
- **Merge Loops**: Conflict resolution creates new conflicts
- **Metadata Loops**: Timestamp/permission changes trigger re-sync

## 2. Message Ordering in P2P Context

### 2.1 Multi-Source Ordering Issues
- **Conflicting Orders**: A→B and C→B send conflicting file versions
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple parties modify same file simultaneously
- **Clock Skew**: Different system times across peers
- **Network Delay Variance**: Messages arrive in different order than sent
- **Priority Inversion**: Important updates stuck behind bulk transfers
- **Causal Ordering Violation**: Effect arrives before cause
- **Vector Clock Divergence**: Distributed timestamps become inconsistent

### 2.2 P2P-Specific Out-of-Order Scenarios
- **Create After Delete**: B receives delete before create from A
- **Update Without Base**: Modification arrives before initial file
- **Orphaned Updates**: Updates for files that don't exist yet
- **Future Updates**: Updates with future timestamps
- **Partial Directory Sync**: Some files in directory arrive before others
- **Split Brain Updates**: Same file updated differently by network partition
- **Phantom Deletes**: Delete operation for already-deleted file

### 2.3 Multi-Party Ordering Conflicts
- **Three-Way Merge**: A, B, C all modify same file differently
- **Circular Dependencies**: A needs B's file, B needs C's, C needs A's
- **Consensus Failures**: Parties can't agree on file state
- **Quorum Issues**: Not enough parties agree on order
- **Byzantine Ordering**: Malicious party sends different orders to different peers
- **Time Warp**: Party with wrong clock corrupts ordering for all
- **Replay Attacks**: Old messages replayed to revert changes

## 3. Byzantine Failures in P2P

### 3.1 Malicious Peer Behavior
- **Selective Sharing**: Peer shares different versions to different parties
- **Data Poisoning**: Peer sends corrupted files
- **Metadata Lies**: Wrong timestamps, sizes, hashes
- **Flood Attacks**: Peer overwhelms others with messages
- **Drop Attacks**: Peer silently drops certain files
- **Slowloris**: Peer sends data extremely slowly
- **Fork Attacks**: Peer creates divergent file histories

### 3.2 Unintentional Byzantine Behavior
- **Disk Corruption**: Peer unknowingly shares corrupted data
- **Memory Errors**: RAM errors cause inconsistent behavior
- **Software Bugs**: Peer has buggy implementation
- **Clock Issues**: Wildly incorrect system time
- **Partial Failures**: Some operations succeed, others fail
- **Inconsistent State**: Internal state corruption
- **Network Issues**: Packet corruption, reordering

### 3.3 Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- **Voting Mechanisms**: Majority agreement on file state
- **Reputation Systems**: Track peer reliability
- **Redundancy**: Multiple paths for same data
- **Verification**: Hash chains, signatures
- **Isolation**: Quarantine suspicious peers
- **Recovery**: Rebuild state from trusted peers
- **Audit Trails**: Track all operations for forensics

## 4. Network Partition Scenarios

### 4.1 Simple Partitions
- **Two-Way Split**: Network splits into two groups
- **Island Formation**: Each peer isolated from others
- **Bridge Partition**: Only one peer connects two groups
- **Asymmetric Partition**: A can reach B, but B can't reach A
- **Transient Partition**: Brief disconnections
- **Rolling Partition**: Partition moves through network
- **Partial Partition**: Some protocols work, others don't

### 4.2 Partition During Operations
- **Mid-Sync Partition**: Network splits during file transfer
- **Partition During Lock**: Lock acquired but release fails
- **Split Brain Syndrome**: Both partitions elect leaders
- **Divergent State**: Partitions evolve independently
- **Conflict Explosion**: Massive conflicts when partition heals
- **Lost Updates**: Changes in smaller partition lost
- **Zombie Files**: Deleted files resurrect after partition

### 4.3 Partition Recovery
- **Merge Strategies**: How to reconcile divergent states
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic vs manual resolution
- **Version Vectors**: Track causality across partitions
- **Tombstones**: Track deletions during partition
- **Catch-up Sync**: Efficient sync after partition heals
- **Rollback**: Undo operations from minority partition
- **History Reconciliation**: Merge divergent histories

## 5. Performance and Scalability

### 5.1 P2P-Specific Performance Issues
- **Broadcast Storm**: One change triggers N-1 messages
- **Quadratic Growth**: N peers = O(N²) connections
- **Bandwidth Multiplication**: Same file sent to many peers
- **CPU Multiplication**: Same processing for each peer
- **Storage Multiplication**: Multiple copies of logs
- **Network Topology**: Inefficient routing between peers
- **Hot Spots**: Popular files create bottlenecks

### 5.2 Scalability Limits
- **Peer Count Scaling**: Performance vs number of peers
- **File Count Scaling**: Performance vs number of files
- **Message Rate Scaling**: Max sustainable message rate
- **Storage Scaling**: Log growth over time
- **Network Scaling**: Bandwidth requirements
- **CPU Scaling**: Processing overhead
- **Memory Scaling**: RAM usage growth

### 5.3 Optimization Strategies
- **Hierarchical Topology**: Tree structure instead of full mesh
- **Gossip Protocols**: Efficient message propagation
- **Bloom Filters**: Efficient set membership tests
- **Delta Sync**: Only send changes, not full files
- **Compression**: Reduce bandwidth usage
- **Batching**: Group multiple operations
- **Caching**: Avoid redundant processing

## 6. Security in P2P Context

### 6.1 Trust Issues
- **Peer Authentication**: Verify peer identity
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure files aren't tampered
- **Access Control**: Who can sync what files
- **Encryption**: Protect data in transit
- **Key Management**: Distribute and rotate keys
- **Audit Logging**: Track who did what
- **Reputation**: Track peer behavior

### 6.2 Attack Vectors
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercept peer communication
- **Sybil Attack**: Create many fake peers
- **Eclipse Attack**: Isolate peer from network
- **Replay Attack**: Resend old messages
- **DOS Attack**: Overwhelm peers
- **Data Leakage**: Unauthorized access to files
- **Correlation Attack**: Infer data from traffic patterns

### 6.3 Defense Mechanisms
- **Mutual TLS**: Encrypted authenticated channels
- **Message Signing**: Cryptographic signatures
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent flood attacks
- **Access Control Lists**: Fine-grained permissions
- **Intrusion Detection**: Detect anomalous behavior
- **Fail-Safe Modes**: Graceful degradation
- **Security Updates**: Patch distribution
