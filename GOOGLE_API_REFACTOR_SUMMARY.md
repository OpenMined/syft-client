# Google Personal Platform API Refactoring Summary

## Overview

Successfully refactored the Google Personal platform to move all API-specific functionality from the client to the respective transport layers.

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
- `client.py` contained:
  - OAuth2 authentication
  - All Google API service building
  - Gmail sending/receiving logic
  - Gmail label/filter creation
  - Message parsing
  - Attachment handling

### After:
- `client.py` only contains:
  - OAuth2 authentication flow
  - Token management (save/load/refresh)
  - Transport initialization and coordination

- Each transport layer is self-contained:
  - **`gmail.py`**: Gmail API operations, email categorization, labels, filters
  - **`gdrive_files.py`**: Drive API operations, file upload/download, folder management
  - **`gsheets.py`**: Sheets API operations, spreadsheet creation, data handling
  - **`gforms.py`**: Forms API operations, form creation, question generation

## Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each transport manages its own API and functionality
2. **Modularity**: Transport layers can be modified independently
3. **Reusability**: Transport layers could potentially be used by other platforms
4. **Clarity**: Clear boundaries between OAuth2 management and API operations
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to debug and enhance individual transports

## Transport Layer Responsibilities

### Gmail Transport (`gmail.py`)
- Builds Gmail API service
- Creates backend labels and filters
- Sends emails with categorization (notification vs backend)
- Receives and parses emails
- Handles attachments
- Test email verification

### Drive Transport (`gdrive_files.py`)
- Builds Drive API service
- Creates SyftClient folder
- Uploads files with automatic format detection
- Downloads and decodes files
- Shares files with recipients
- Creates public folders

### Sheets Transport (`gsheets.py`)
- Builds Sheets and Drive API services
- Creates spreadsheets with data
- Handles various data formats (strings, dicts, lists)
- Reads shared spreadsheets
- Reconstructs original data types
- Creates public sheets

### Forms Transport (`gforms.py`)
- Builds Forms API service
- Creates forms dynamically based on data
- Generates appropriate question types
- Returns form URLs
- Handles form response retrieval (placeholder)

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Credential Passing**: Client passes OAuth2 credentials to transports during setup
2. **Service Building**: Each transport builds its own API service(s)
3. **Error Handling**: Each transport handles its own API errors gracefully
4. **Data Serialization**: Consistent approach to handling different data types
5. **Public Access**: Support for creating publicly accessible resources

## Usage Example

```python
from syft_client import login

# OAuth2 authentication handled by client
client = login("user@gmail.com")

# Access transport layers
gmail = client.platforms['google_personal'].transports['gmail']
drive = client.platforms['google_personal'].transports['gdrive_files']
sheets = client.platforms['google_personal'].transports['gsheets']
forms = client.platforms['google_personal'].transports['gforms']

# Each transport manages its own operations
gmail.send_notification("recipient@email.com", "Hello!")
drive.send("recipient@email.com", {"data": "value"})
sheets.send("recipient@email.com", [{"col1": "val1", "col2": "val2"}])
forms.send("recipient@email.com", {"field1": "default1", "field2": "default2"})
```

## Security Notes

- OAuth2 tokens remain centralized in the client
- Each transport receives credentials but doesn't manage tokens
- API services are built per-transport for isolation
- Permissions are scoped appropriately for each service
