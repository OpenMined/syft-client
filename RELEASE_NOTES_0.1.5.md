### üêõ Bug Fixes

## Installation

```bash
pip install syft-client==0.1.5
```

## Upgrading from 0.1.4

## What's Fixed

1. **Token Storage Bug**: Previously, when saving authentication tokens, `client_id` and `client_secret` were being saved twice in the token dictionary. This has been fixed.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: The GitHub Actions workflow now properly defines sanitized email variables before using them, preventing undefined variable errors during testing.

- Interactive tutorial notebook ready for Google Colab
- Clear API reference with examples
- Roadmap for future development

## Breaking Changes

None. This release is fully backward compatible with v0.1.4.
