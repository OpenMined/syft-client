# Google OAuth2 Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up OAuth2 authentication for the Google Personal platform in syft-client.

## Overview

The Google Personal platform now uses OAuth2 exclusively for authentication. This provides:
- Better security than app passwords
- Automatic token refresh
- Access to all Google APIs (Gmail, Drive, Sheets, Forms)
- Programmatic creation of Gmail filters and labels

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Note your project ID

### 2. Enable Required APIs

In your Google Cloud project, enable these APIs:
1. Gmail API
2. Google Drive API
3. Google Sheets API
4. Google Forms API

You can enable them from the [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).

### 3. Create OAuth2 Credentials

1. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose "Desktop app" as the application type
4. Name it "Syft Client" (or any name you prefer)
5. Click "Create"
6. Download the credentials JSON file

### 4. Install Credentials

Place the downloaded `credentials.json` file in one of these locations:
- `~/.syft/credentials.json` (recommended)
- `~/.syft/google_oauth/credentials.json`
- Current working directory

### 5. First Login

```python
from syft_client import login

# This will open a browser for OAuth2 consent
client = login("your.email@gmail.com", verbose=True)
```

On first login:
1. A browser window will open
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Grant permissions for Gmail, Drive, Sheets, and Forms
4. The token will be saved for future use

## Token Management

- Tokens are stored in `~/.syft/google_oauth/[your_email]/`
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when expired
- Only the 5 most recent tokens are kept
- Tokens are valid for 1 hour, refresh tokens last longer

## Email Categorization

The Gmail transport automatically:
1. Creates a "SyftBackend" label for backend emails
2. Sets up a filter to route `[SYFT-DATA]` emails to this label
3. Keeps notification emails `[SYFT]` in your inbox

## Environment Variables

- `SYFT_GOOGLE_USE_APP_PASSWORD=true` - Forces app password auth (only for SMTP platform now)

## Troubleshooting

### "OAuth2 credentials.json not found"
- Make sure you downloaded the credentials from Google Cloud Console
- Place it in `~/.syft/credentials.json`

### "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"
- Make sure you're using "Desktop app" type credentials
- Check that all required APIs are enabled

### Browser doesn't open
- Make sure you're in an environment that supports browser launch
- You may need to manually copy the authorization URL

## Security Notes

- Never commit `credentials.json` to version control
- Tokens are stored with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- Each email account has its own token storage
