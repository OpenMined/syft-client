# Message Queue Test Strategy for Syft-Sync

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive test strategy for the message queue and synchronization mechanisms between the sender (watcher) and receiver in syft-sync, focusing on all possible failure modes, race conditions, and edge cases that could corrupt the final synchronized state.

## 1. Message Ordering Issues

### 1.1 Out-of-Order Delivery
- **Reverse Order**: Updates arrive before creates
- **Shuffled Updates**: Multiple updates arrive in wrong sequence
- **Delete Before Create**: Deletion event arrives before creation
- **Move Chain Disorder**: A→B→C moves arrive as A→C, then B→C
- **Interleaved Operations**: Operations on different files interleaved incorrectly
- **Timestamp Inversion**: Later events have earlier timestamps
- **Clock Skew**: Sender and receiver have different system times
- **Partial Ordering**: Some messages ordered, others random

### 1.2 Version Conflicts
- **Concurrent Modifications**: Two processes modify same file simultaneously
- **Branching Histories**: File modified in two different ways creating branches
- **Version Number Gaps**: Missing versions in sequence (v1, v2, v5)
- **Duplicate Version IDs**: Same version ID used for different changes
- **Version Rollback**: Older version arrives after newer
- **Phantom Versions**: References to versions that don't exist

### 1.3 Timestamp Issues
- **Clock Drift**: Gradual time divergence between systems
- **Time Jumps**: System clock adjusted during operation
- **Daylight Saving**: Timestamp ambiguity during DST changes
- **Timezone Confusion**: Mixed timezone timestamps
- **Microsecond Collisions**: Multiple events in same microsecond
- **Negative Time**: Clock moved backwards
- **Leap Second Handling**: Extra second causing ordering issues

## 2. Message Loss and Duplication

### 2.1 Lost Messages
- **Single Message Loss**: Random individual messages lost
- **Burst Loss**: Sequence of messages lost together
- **Pattern Loss**: Every Nth message lost
- **Critical Message Loss**: Create/delete operations lost
- **Silent Loss**: No error indication of lost messages
- **Partial Message Loss**: Message header arrives but not content
- **End-of-Stream Loss**: Final messages in sequence lost

### 2.2 Duplicate Messages
- **Exact Duplicates**: Same message delivered multiple times
- **Near Duplicates**: Same operation with different timestamps
- **Amplification**: Single operation generates multiple messages
- **Echo Effects**: Messages bouncing back and forth
- **Replay Attacks**: Old messages replayed later
- **Duplicate Bursts**: Groups of messages duplicated
- **Partial Duplicates**: Only parts of message duplicated

### 2.3 Message Corruption
- **Bit Flips**: Random bit corruption in transit
- **Truncation**: Messages cut off mid-transmission
- **Concatenation**: Multiple messages merged together
- **Header Corruption**: Metadata corrupted but content intact
- **Content Corruption**: Content corrupted but metadata intact
- **Encoding Issues**: Character encoding corruption
- **Compression Errors**: Decompression failures

## 3. Queue Overflow and Performance Issues

### 3.1 Queue Saturation
- **Producer Faster than Consumer**: Messages accumulate
- **Memory Exhaustion**: Queue grows until OOM
- **Disk Full**: Persistent queue fills disk
- **Queue Overflow**: New messages dropped
- **Priority Inversion**: Important messages stuck behind bulk
- **Head-of-Line Blocking**: One bad message blocks all
- **Backpressure Failure**: No flow control feedback

### 3.2 Performance Degradation
- **Exponential Slowdown**: Processing time increases exponentially
- **Death Spiral**: System gets progressively slower
- **Thundering Herd**: All receivers wake simultaneously
- **Queue Thrashing**: Constant reorganization overhead
- **Lock Contention**: Multiple processes fighting for queue
- **Context Switch Storm**: Too many threads/processes
- **Cache Misses**: Queue too large for CPU cache

### 3.3 Resource Leaks
- **Memory Leaks**: Unprocessed messages accumulate
- **File Handle Leaks**: Open files never closed
- **Socket Leaks**: Network connections not released
- **Thread Leaks**: Worker threads never terminate
- **Disk Space Leaks**: Temporary files never cleaned
- **Lock Leaks**: Locks acquired but never released

## 4. Network and Transport Issues

### 4.1 Network Failures
- **Connection Drops**: TCP connection lost mid-transfer
- **Partial Sends**: Message partially transmitted
- **Network Partition**: Sender/receiver can't communicate
- **Asymmetric Partition**: Can send but not receive
- **Intermittent Connectivity**: Connection flapping
- **High Latency**: Messages severely delayed
- **Packet Loss**: UDP-style random packet drops
- **MTU Issues**: Messages fragmented incorrectly

### 4.2 Protocol Violations
- **Wrong Protocol Version**: Incompatible sender/receiver
- **Malformed Messages**: Invalid message structure
- **Missing Fields**: Required fields absent
- **Extra Fields**: Unknown fields present
- **Type Mismatches**: String where number expected
- **Encoding Mismatches**: UTF-8 vs ASCII issues
- **Endianness Issues**: Byte order problems

### 4.3 Security and Authentication
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Messages intercepted/modified
- **Replay Attacks**: Old messages resent
- **Spoofed Sender**: Fake sender identity
- **Tampered Messages**: Content modified in transit
- **Unauthorized Access**: Receiver accepts bad messages
- **Certificate Expiry**: TLS certs expire mid-operation
- **Key Rotation**: Encryption keys change during sync

## 5. State Synchronization Issues

### 5.1 Initial State Mismatches
- **Different Starting Points**: Sender/receiver have different initial files
- **Partial Initial Sync**: Only some files initially synced
- **Stale Initial State**: Receiver has outdated versions
- **Ghost Files**: Receiver has files sender doesn't
- **Permission Differences**: Files exist but can't be read
- **Symbolic Link Confusion**: Links treated as files or vice versa

### 5.2 Incremental Sync Failures
- **Missed Updates**: Some changes not captured
- **Double Application**: Same change applied twice
- **Conflict Resolution**: Different conflict strategies
- **Merge Failures**: Can't merge concurrent changes
- **Rollback Issues**: Can't undo partially applied changes
- **State Divergence**: Gradual drift between sender/receiver

### 5.3 Recovery and Restart Issues
- **Incomplete Recovery**: Some state not restored
- **Recovery Loops**: System keeps trying to recover
- **Checkpoint Corruption**: Saved state is invalid
- **Mid-Recovery Crash**: Crash during recovery process
- **Partial Recovery**: Only some files recovered
- **Recovery Ordering**: Files recovered in wrong order
- **Zombie State**: Old state resurfaces after recovery

## 6. Edge Cases and Race Conditions

### 6.1 Rapid File Operations
- **Create-Delete-Create**: File recreated immediately
- **Rename Chains**: A→B→C→A circular renames
- **Touch Storms**: File touched thousands of times
- **Size Oscillation**: File size changes rapidly
- **Permission Flapping**: Permissions change constantly
- **Content Thrashing**: Content changes faster than sync

### 6.2 Directory Operations
- **Directory Rename During Sync**: Parent renamed while syncing children

- **Cross-Device Moves**: Move across filesystem boundaries
- **Directory Deletion with Active Files**: Delete dir while files being written
- **Deep Nesting Changes**: Very deep directory trees modified
- **Wide Directory Changes**: Directories with 10000+ files

### 6.3 File System Limits
- **Path Length Exceeded**: Paths longer than system limit
- **Filename Length Exceeded**: Names too long
- **Special Characters**: Null bytes, newlines in names
- **Reserved Names**: CON, PRN, AUX on Windows
- **Case Sensitivity**: FILE.txt vs file.txt
- **Unicode Normalization**: é vs e + combining accent

## 7. Complex Failure Scenarios
